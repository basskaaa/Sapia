Elves are often very exclusive, as their long lifespan lets them train extensively in many different skills to the point of mastery, and anything less is considered juvenile.

Dreams are particularly significant within the culture of elves, as they grant visions into the past and future. In an elfâ€™s youth (roughly 100 years) they see into the collective consciousness of all elves past, In maturity (roughly 500 years) they see their own past, and in decay (roughly 100 years) they can grasp into the eyes of future elves.

For this reason, many elves seek adventure in their youth to create wonderous memories to relive later in life, while also letting them escape the culture of perfectionism instilled in elven communities. However, risking danger is looked down upon by the High Elves, who are trying to preserve what remains of the elves after the fall of the Calamity almost 1000 years ago.

The High Elves are a young community in the eyes of their species, who are fiercely afraid of any potential threats to their people. After the Calamity, the elves lost much of their knowledge and history - a loss that the High Elves attempt to recover from by rigorously documenting the dreams of their youth, who spend their own time caring and venerating the elderly. The dreams of the elderly are carefully studied, looking for any potential for averting the destruction of the elves.

In maturity, most elves travel to the Vulcan Isles to study, practice, and labour to provide goods and advancement for their people. They all remember the mistakes of their past, and take pride in their extreme precaution of the study of arcana to avoid ever repeating them.
