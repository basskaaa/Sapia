Dwarves have an unrivalled veneration of their ancestors, with many cultural traditions to celebrate their honour and strength. Cursing anotherâ€™s descendants is a heinous insult, and drunken fights over honour occur daily in most circles.

They are generally untrusting to other species, fearing that they still hold grudges from the cruelty of the ancient Dalladh Dominion. This is particularly strong against elves, after the infamous Day of Crushing. The elves of Leor in their ascent to power took revenge against the Dalladh Dominion for their crimes, shutting them away in their strongholds for many years.

It is long-lived species the dwarves have the least trust for, which is lesser extended to humans and the like. They often make fun of humans for their short memories, however they have a deep gratitude for the forgiveness it permits them.

Dwarves have a mild allergy to ingesting non-alcoholic liquids, and so almost always drink ale or grog to avoid the eczema-like rashes.

Some dwarven communities have a unique history with the dragons, who have granted them great power in the past. By offering great riches to the dragons, dwarves have acquired a taste of draconic magic, an elemental tool that has been used in great effect throughout history.
