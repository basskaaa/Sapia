- Strength score
- Dexterity score
- Constitution score
- Defence
- Current hit points
- Current stamina points

You can gauge a number of characteristics equal to your intelligence modifier per short rest.

Additionally, you use a d10 instead of a d6 on Goal Challenges to track a creature.

### Defensive Ally

Additionally, you can choose another Weapon Type proficiency, and you can choose one weapon in your inventory per long rest to gain the Masterwork trait when wielded by you.

### Natural Fighter

8th level - You are no longer affected by difficult terrain.

Additionally, the fighting style you previously chose is upgraded.

- **Improved Sharp Aim**
    
    Your ranged weapon attacks deal an additional damage die to creatures over 30 ft away from you.
    
- **Improved Defender**
    
    Every time you are hit by an attack, your Defence increases by 1 until the start of your next turn.
    
- **Improved Duellist**
    
    When you are wielding only a melee weapon in one hand, and you are only engaged with one target within reach, your attacks deal an additional damage die.

    When you roll max damage on at least one damage die with a Great Weapon attack, every creature within a 20ft radius you must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or fall prone.
    
- **Improved Dual Wielder**
    
    When dual wielding weapons, you can make an additional attack as part of the move [Quick Attack](https://www.notion.so/Quick-Attack-3b4911a4df0346a895acb5a7157bb18e?pvs=21), and add your ability modifier to damage rolls for the ability.
    

### Iron Mind

14th level - When you make an attack roll and the number rolled on the d20 is less than your proficiency bonus, you may treat the roll as equal to your proficiency bonus.

Additionally, opportunity attacks against you are made at disadvantage. You can now also learn information about the following characteristics of a creature as part of your ‘Know Your Enemy’ trait: Wisdom score, Intelligence score, Charisma score, current mana points.

### Feral Senses

18th level - Attacks made by allied creatures within 5ft of you and the target are made at advantage.

Once per short rest, when you reach 0 stamina, you gain an additional use of Action Surge.

Additionally, when you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 60 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.
