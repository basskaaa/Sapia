Gnomes are what becomes of the children that elves steal. When elves get a wild hair to raise a child, they sneak into human lands and steal a baby. In its place they leave a changeling-a log of alder wood or a goblin wrapped in a glamour of a human child. The glamour never lasts very long. Then they take the human baby back to Elf lands and turn it into a gnome.  
  
A gnome has the blessing of immortality but not agelessness. A gnome grows old but never dies. They never grow much larger than human children, but soon grow liver spots, long beards, bee-sting noses, yellowed nails, hunched backs. Eventually, they might grow into trees.Â   
  
By the time this happens, their elven "parents" have long since lost interest.
