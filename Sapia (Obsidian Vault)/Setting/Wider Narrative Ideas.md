Start of the arrival of the Frostmaiden.
Deal with the Wall of Radiance cutting off the realms after the Frostmaiden defeats Ulutiu.
Don't include Ythryn plot or Crenshinibon. Just focus on defeating Frostmaiden, Frostlight Walkers and reconnecting the towns with the outside world.
Wall of Radiance cuts off light.
