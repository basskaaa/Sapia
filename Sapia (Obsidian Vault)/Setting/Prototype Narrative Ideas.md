Begin with souls-esque grand plot cutscene explaining fire of arioch and rise of life from the bones of dragons.

Start in a prison cell in a town outpost with a loud metal bang at the cell door, waking you from slumber (think Bastion opening) being released by the sheriff, 'Your time is up. Get out.' Your crime is not elaborated on. People pay you no attention. You take your gear from the prisoners belongings and step out into the cold.

Guards are talking between themselves. Again, they don't give you attention and shoo you if you linger, 'Anyone know this one? No? Well, you, fuck off then.' They mention how the food has been foul recently, littered with rat droppings.

'Must be an infestation in the food cellar.'
'Better get old man Geller on that.'
'He's off sick. Was bit by one of 'em and now his 'ole body's red. Must've pissed off the gods a little.'
'Well I aint doing it then. Need all the coin I can get and the Masters won't take well to me being sick.'
'Tell me about it.'
'Maybe we can get Jack to sort it out. Just don't tell him about Geller.'
'You think he's heard already?'
'Better pray he hasn't. I don't know how much more I can take eating rat shit nuggets in my stew.'
'Wonder if the cooks are doing it on purpose? I bet they've got a jar of shit seasoning just for this occasion. I knew they were holding a grudge after Ralan.'
'They know that wasn't us.'
'I've heard rumours mate. They've got it out for us.'
'But without us they'd all be dead, not just Ralan. We are the protectors of the land.'
'Protector of the land'- my arse! You couldn't protect a hog if it were between your legs.'
'Either you shut your mouth or I will.' - Walks off to duty, followed by the rest

Nearby, the cellar door is left unattended. If the rats are dealt with, the player gets the respect of two guards, who offer them a quest to retrieve an item, advising them to make a blessing to the spirit before they go.

Alternatively, Guard Jack can be found in a building.

Prototype ends by trade caravan arriving, offering a lift to the nearest town for some gold.
