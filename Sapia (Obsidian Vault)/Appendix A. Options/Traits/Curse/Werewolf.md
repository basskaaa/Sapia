Curse

# Werewolf

You are hungry for the blood of the innocent, under the spell of the God of Lycanthropes, Malar the Ravenous. You can choose to embrace the hunger, or fight it.

Once per long rest, you can choose to transform into a Werewolf. Once in this form, you must drink the blood of an innocent creature to return, though you can choose to remain in the Werewolf form for as long as you wish after this has been performed.

On the night of the full moon, the hunger is unstoppable and you transform against your will.

As a Werewolf, your unarmed attacks increase to 2d10 damage dice. At the start of each of your turns, you restore Hit Points equal to your Proficiency Modifier. When in range of an unconscious target, you can choose to transform them into a Werewolf, a process which takes until the next full moon to develop fully. However, you are Vulnerable to attacks from Silvered weapons.

Some Werewolves gather in clans, while some live as hermits or attempt to conceal their curse from society.
