You attempt to move unheard, provided you are outside of a creature's line of sight. Make a Control check. If the result of the Control check is greater than the Passive Perception of any creatures within 30ft, they remain unaware of you until you enter their line of sight or otherwise draw attention.

*Upcast: Add 1 to the result of the Control check*

*Notes: You are silent to any creatures beyond 30ft, but can still draw their attention. Drawing attention includes making noise, causing light, attacking, or any other such action. Being in cover helps to reduce drawing attention.*
