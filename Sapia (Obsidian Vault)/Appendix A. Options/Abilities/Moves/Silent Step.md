You move unheard, provided you are outside of a creature's line of sight. Any creatures within 30ft remain unaware of you until you enter their line of sight or otherwise draw attention.

*Upcast: Add 1 to the result of the Control check*

*Notes: You can can still draw the attention of creatures beyond 30ft. Drawing attention includes making noise, causing light, attacking, or any other such action. Being in cover helps to reduce drawing attention.*
