- resurrections require the offering of a body part. the further the body is from life, the more extreme the required offering gets. if the body has been dead for over a year, someone must sacrifice their life to resurrect it. if it has been longer, multiple people must sacrifice their life. this can lead to cults all sacrificing themselves to bring an ancient being back to life.

[Progress Clocks](https://bladesinthedark.com/progress-clocks)

**Master of Death:** You have a better sense than most for the psychology of the dead. You have advantage on any Charisma (Persuasion) or (Intimidation) checks while interacting with the souls of the dead or undead creatures.

**Vulture Eye:** You have advantage on Wisdom (Medicine) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks relating to dead bodies, such as discovering cause or time of death.

**Discipline:** You have drilled extensively, maintaining rigid standards of discipline. You use Intelligence instead of Dexterity when determining Initiative rolls.

**Broom of Flying:** At 3rd level, a graduate of the Citadel becomes a Stormguard or Weatherwitch and is granted a _Broom of Flying_. They may be called upon to perform military duties if a member of the Stromguard or to help deal with dangerous storms, fires, or floods if a Weatherwitch.

**Diabolic Domination:** Graduates of Fiend’s College quickly learn to command demons, typically acquiring familiars and binding lesser demons early in their course of study. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks against fiends of all kinds and on any saving throws against Charm spells cast by demons.

**Infernal Influence:** Members of Fiend’s College are treated with considerable respect amongst Hex’s upper crust. You have advantage on all Charisma checks amongst Hex’s elites and begin with one significant favour from former school friends that you can cash in at any time.

**Financial Wizard:** You are trusted implicitly concerning money given the Institute’s deep pockets and strong track record of economic predictions. In any pecuniary matter you have advantage on any Charisma (Persuasion) or (Deception) checks.

**Foretelling:** Regular study of whatever omens you are trained to examine furnishes you with insight into the future. At the beginning of each session, the DM must slide you a note with a hint about the upcoming session. This might indicate a monster’s weakness, the presence of a secret passage, part of the solution to a puzzle, or some similar detail. This is distinct from casting any particular spell – it represents the results of your repeated, routine examination of various portents.

**Alienism:**  Melchior’s students have made extensive study of the sapient mind. You are proficient in the Insight skill and can always use Intelligence instead of Wisdom when making Insight checks.

**Empiricism:** When experimenting with unknown potions, plants, fungi, or other substances, you have advantage on any saving throws against potential negative effects.

**Fleshsculptor:** Your training allows you to better cultivate magical creatures, producing artificial forms of life. You have advantage on any ability checks needed to create magical life-forms such as homunculi or chimerae and can produce such beings in half the time as other mages.

**Student of Secrecy:**  When wearing a disguise, either magical or mundane, you can use your Intelligence score instead of Charisma when making Deception checks, and you can use your Intelligence score instead of Wisdom when making Perception checks to spot traps or secret doors.

**Warder Ring:**  All officers of the Warders possess a glyph-etched ring that serves as their symbol of office. This is obtained at 3rd  level and functions as a _Ring of Protection +1._

Something I started doing when a player asked to make an insight check is to have the player tell me what they’re thinking of the target NPC before they roll.

a better way to use insight is to glean the npc bonds flaws and ideals. I use that advice to great success

“You can’t tell if they are lying but they seem to be a greedy sob who would sell their own mother for coin.”

“It’s clear that this npc would do anything to protect their child”

Initiative Swap. Immediately after you roll Initiative, you can swap your Initiative with the Initiative of one willing ally in the same combat. You can’t make this swap if you or the ally is Incapacitated.*

healer trait - you can use an action to allow the target to spend recovery dice.

The Warlord could interact with the new inspiration system. Maybe they’d get it on a 19 or 20, and when they use or give out excess inspiration, they get some kind of benefit.

I also think all classes will have features that activate when they crit. It probably won't just be "double damage" like it used to be. It'll be interesting and fun ways that critting will buff or debuff or whatever else.

I think a good defensice mechanic i used in one of the best solo fights i ever ran was giving the boss a "overheat" mechanic. the players were in a fight with a giant robot, and it was so unstable it could overheat at any moment. the ability was "if the robot starts its turn under any condition, it can gain 1 level of overheat and remove all effects. but for every level of overheat it lowered it's Ac by 2, at 5 level of overheat, the robot loses 1 legendary action". that gave the encounter a more dynamic vibe, because at the start the robot had super high Ac and the only real way to damage it was with saves. but after about 4 rounds, attacks became much more effective than saving throws because the robot was super easy to hit. a mechanic that changes the strength of the boss ir reavels new weaknesses during the fight is a fun way in my opinion to spice up combat

Elderly trait - you gain 2 lifestyle options, and at the end of a long rest you can choose to roll a d6, and corresponding in order, you reroll a a new attribute score for a random attribute until the end of a long rest.

One of my favorite boss encounters I've ever seen was when the party fought agaisnt a chess themed boss with a trait that forced everybody to move like chess pieces in a 8×8 square board until the fight was over . The players rolled to determine their piece , the boss could change what piece it was with it's action and bonus action , altering it's movement , attacks and abilities ( the rook form making a heavy hitting single target attacks in straight lines and pushing back enemies , the bishop firing perpendicular laser that hit everybody within the attacks firing lane , knight allowing the boss to not trigger opportuny attacks much to the Sentinel Barbarians dismay , etc ) and it could also summon chess piece minions with legendary actions that had lesser veriations of the bosses abilities . This fight made the party of mostly martial level 13 PC's ( casters & half casters outside Artificer weren't allowed due to the campaign being set in the world of One Piece , where most magic was relegated to items that granted the users powers ) and an NPC rogue and healer wrack their brains about positioning so melee characters could still hit the boss and the healer couldn't be targeted

undead warlock - when you recover from the wounded condition, you do not suffer a point of exhaustion.

no specific types of armour. just light (+2), medium (+4), and heavy (+6), with +1,+2, and +3 versions. dm flavours the armour however they want - you can have light plate mail etc. you need the specific armour training traits to be able to wear the armour.

slow spell - move the target back one place in initiative order

They should take notes from 3.X and have medium armour with strength requirements and varying degrees of dex bonus caps.

The “if you end your turn in mid-air you fall down 500 feet” rule, and the way it interacts with jumps that are longer than your movement.

The way I rule it is that if you make a jump longer than your movement speed in-combat, you end the turn in mid-air, and at the beginning of your next turn you must continue move in the direction that your jump was made in, and you repeat this process for however many turns it takes for your jump distance to run out.

If you have ranged attacks or spells I also let you use them during the “mid jump” sections, and I also let monsters attack you mid jump to end your movement and make you fall.

I like to go with the, 'a bird is all birds, a tree all trees' approach. So you're speaking to the spiritual representation of the creature, who then tells you what happened to to this particular bird or tree.

_''This little one saw three of your kind travelling north an hour ago. I believe they deserve a reward, yes? Those rations should suffice.''_

And if you dick over one bird, every other bird knows about it, because they're all _**bird**_. On the flipside, friend of _**bird**_ is friend of all birds!

You are always either taking or dealing damage when you are hit. If you miss an attack, you take some damage, if you hit the target takes more damage.

2m = 6ft, maybe use a 2m grid instead of 5ft?

proficiency in spells? damage types? schools?

cleric - a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest, when you deal damage to a target of a number greater than your current hit point total, you can heal a target within 5ft of you for 1d8+ability modifier hit points.

alignment as selfish/neutral/selfless and lawful/neutral/chaotic

If you provide an incentive and clearly show beforehand how it will benefit the players, I've found they will be far more invested in questing. By giving them an overarching goal, you can set limits across this goal that they can choose to engage with.

For example, money. The 5e system as designed does a really poor job of incentivising earning money. In most cases, it's not useful to the player or their character, and in the cases where it is, are rarely designed in interesting ways. You can't invest in better gear beyond full plate armour, which never feels like it's worth the cost compared to the price of all other amour options. You can use it for spell components, which just let you continue questing for a bit longer and rarely feel like an investment that adds to interesting gameplay.

A great low level goal that can be achieved in 5e is something like: you are trapped in a dungeon, the way out is easy to get to but requires a key that can only be found if you delve deeper. I used this to great effect to begin my most recent campaign, but it can only be used in specific cases that don't give the impression of stripping players of agency, ie at the start of a campaign or in the case of a tpk where the enemy chooses to imprison you rather than outright kill you.

An overarching goal takes more work to establish, but can serve as a motivator for questing and exploring. By npcs showing generosity to the pcs, and then establishing a shared threat against both the npcs and pcs, you can help the players feel like the quests they are performing to improve their characters are also building towards a change in the lives of the npcs. This can offer a sense of catharsis as the pcs feel they are 'paying their debts' back to the generous npcs, or instead provoke vengeance as the player's actions have started a chain that resulted in poor fates for the npcs.

The overarching goal can help build a foundation for other incentives to feel enticing. In my current game, the pcs are investigating many threads related to the survival of the people of Icewind Dale, and have reached a point where they are powerfully motivated by the overarching goal, but to help them achieve the necessary steps they must travel. Both the pcs and the npcs of Icewind Dale are at threat of time, so they have an incentive to get mounts to travel quicker, however, mounts are expensive. So, by questing to earn money to afford mounts, they are also serving the towns and building connections with the world and characters.

**Lockpicking**

Locks and doors have hit points that can be damaged by attempting a lockpicking check.

To attempt to pick a lock, roll a dexterity check, and add your proficiency modifier if you are proficient in thieves’ tools. If the total is above the lock’s number of hit points, the lock opens.

If the lock remains locked and you have lockpicks in your inventory, you can take damage equal to your proficiency modifier to add the 1d6 to your roll. You can continue to take damage to increase the total.

However, if you roll a 1 on any dice, the lock is jammed. To unjam a lock, you must succeed on a sleight of hand check against a DC equal to the remaining hit points of the lock. If you succeed, you can reroll the die that landed on a 1. If you fail, the lock is broken, cannot be picked or used, and shows visible signs of damage.

**Creating New Worlds**

When you spend Dalls, you begin to influence the world around you.

If you have a hoard of treasure conquered from an ancient dungeon, you will need to hire people to help move it to a more secure location (unless you make the dungeon your base). You will need to guard it from thieves, and the guards and workers will need to be paid. You can’t pay them from your hoard forever, or that will defeat the point of guarding it entirely, so you must find other ways of income. You might start a business, and this business will need workers and will pay tax. If you have enough money, you will be paying a significant amount of it as tax, so you might choose to move elsewhere and start your own domain.

Now, your workers and residents of your land pay tax to you. You can afford a castle and guards, but they all need to be fed. You start a farming system around your land, and as your population grows so does the land you need to feed it. You need more land, and so you start a war. You need a stronger military to win, so you make an oath of loyalty to a nearby knight and together you win the war. You now owe political favour, and grow your military to support it. Eventually, the king arrives demanding for tax payments. You decide this will end, and grow your military to offer it to other states so they will support you in the fight against the king. The king is now not strong enough to defeat your forces, and you become a new nation, having all your allies swear oaths of loyalty to you. Now they all pay tax to you. You continue investing in military, requiring advancement in all other areas. You need more land to feed more soldiers. You declare war on the kings nation, and win.

Etc

There are four avenues of investment: Hero, Innovator, Priest, or Warlord
