Every creature has a level and an associated power, which is your level divided by 3 and rounded up, as seen in the following:
- Level 1-3 - +1
- Level 4-6 - +2
- Level 7-9 - +3
- Level 10-12 - +4
- Level 13-16 - +5
- Level 17-18 - +6
- Level 19-20 - +7

A creature can increase their level by gathering experience through encounters. Each encounter has an experience value based on its difficulty, and when you reach an experience threshold you level up.
The experience threshold for levelling up is calculated by the level times 10, and an encounter's experience value is often an arbitrary number decided by the GM based on the difficulty of the encounter.
