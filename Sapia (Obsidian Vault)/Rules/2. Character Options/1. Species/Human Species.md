Their are few things that the 'long-lived' peoples fear more than humans. Their keen intellect, versatility, and quick maturation period, make them reckless and impossible to truly control. If left unchecked, humans in great numbers could overcome almost any mortal threat, though will almost certainly lead themselves down dark paths due to their youth and forgetful nature. Their demand for iteration and evolution is uncanny and often contradicts their short-sighted greed. Only the wisest of the humans will lead their people to greatness, yet this greatness will rarely continue as such for more than a single short lifetime.

In the modern age, humans have flourished in the aftermath of the Calamity and the fall of the elven dominion over the Realms. Their numbers have grown vast and conquest for the West has consumed their attention for hundreds of years. For 100 years, the Great Houses of Coria have balanced on a doomed alliance under faith in the Archon Twins, yet upon their death, a war of succession will once more sweep through the Realms.
