Dwarves are short, stocky creatures, known widely for their obsessive tendencies and love of all things fermented. As a people, they value honour and tradition of the clan above all, though an innate greed runs through their blood. Their dreams are inlaid with promises of great hoards of gems and metals. Promises that can lead them down paths of greatness or corruption. For most dwarves, drinking is the accepted way to quell their golden obsession, and therefore it is foundational in the survival of the clan.
