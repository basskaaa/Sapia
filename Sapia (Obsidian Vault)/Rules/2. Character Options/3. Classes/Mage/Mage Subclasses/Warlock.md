# School of Evocation

### **Sculpt Spells**

2nd level - Your damage die for rank 0 evocation spells is increased to a d10.

When you cast an evocation spell, you can choose any number of creatures to automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell.

### **Potent Cantrip**

5th level - Your rank 0 spells affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your spell, the creature takes half damage but suffers no additional effect from the spell. Your cantrips also bypass damage resistances.

Additionally, you can add your strength modifier to the damage roll of evocation spells.

### **Empowered Evocation**

8th level - You have advantage on checks to retain concentration on evocation spells.

Additionally, you can change the damage type of evocation spells you cast for one mana before you cast them to any one of the elemental damage types.

### Experimental Synergy

14th level - Once per short rest, when you cast a spell that requires a saving throw, you can change the required saving throw to one of Fortitude, Reflex, or Willpower.

Additionally, you gain resistance to one damage type of your choice that can be changed on a long rest.

### **Overchannel**

18th level - Once per long rest, when you cast an evocation spell, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

After you have taken a short rest after using this feature, you can use it again, taking **2d12** psychic damage for each spell rank cast, immediately after you cast it. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.
