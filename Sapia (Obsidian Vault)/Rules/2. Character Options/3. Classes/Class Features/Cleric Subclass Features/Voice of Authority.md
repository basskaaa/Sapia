2nd level - During each long rest, you are given a task
from your deity such as ‘Defeat the beast haunting
the forest.’ The task is chosen by the GM, and must be
relevant, challenging, but achievable.
If the task is successfully achieved before the start of
the next long rest, you gain one point in your portent
pool which lasts until seven days have passed.
At any point in the next seven days, you can spend a
portent pool to decide the outcome of any dice roll.
This can occur before or after it has been rolled.
