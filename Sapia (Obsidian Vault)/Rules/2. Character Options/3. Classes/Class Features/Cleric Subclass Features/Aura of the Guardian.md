5th level - you can shield others from harm at the cost
of your own health. When a creature within 30 feet of
you takes damage, you can use your reaction to
magically take that damage, instead of the target. This
feature doesn’t transfer any other effects that might
accompany the damage, and this damage can’t be
reduced in any way.
