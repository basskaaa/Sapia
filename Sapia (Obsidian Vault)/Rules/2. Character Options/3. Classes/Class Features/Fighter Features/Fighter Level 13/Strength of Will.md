13th level - Once on each of your turns, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

Additionally, you can now use Indomitable twice per long rest, and you can use the move â€£ as though it was an additional rank lower.
