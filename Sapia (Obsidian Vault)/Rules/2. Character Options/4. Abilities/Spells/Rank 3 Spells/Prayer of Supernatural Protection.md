The target gains benefits against celestials, aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead:

- Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target.
- The target cannot be [Charmed](https://www.notion.so/Charmed-0db31730a0a240e1af8915e168283ee0?pvs=21), [Frightened](https://www.notion.so/Frightened-489e813459ee48649437a1006e3ae908?pvs=21), or possessed by them, and has advantage on rolls to break these conditions.
