You summon an avalanche in 20 ft radius centred on a point. Each target within range must follow the â€£ rules against your ability DC.

The snow pile melts at the start of your next turn after the duration has passed.

Upcast: The range increases by 10 ft and the damage increases by 1d10 per upcast.
