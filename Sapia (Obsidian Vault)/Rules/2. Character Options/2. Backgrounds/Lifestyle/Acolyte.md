Your faith in the gods guides you through hard times and tough decisions. You have dedicated yourself to them, such that you might receive their blessing and share it with others.

*'All must venerate out of fear, for the gods may smite us at their whim. But hear my words now, there is a truer life to be lived in faith. Through love in that which is more than we may ever become, we might feel the arms of creation lift us into a new world.' - The Judge's Prayer*
