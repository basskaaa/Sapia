In each adventuring day, there can be up to 12 events. [[Events]] can be combat, dialogue, travel, or exploration, and must include rest unless the adventurers wish to take a [[Exhaustion Points|Point of Exhaustion]]. After 12 events have passed, it is the next adventuring day.

[[Events]] are managed by the DM, who determines when each event starts and finishes. A particularly long combat or dialogue might take 2 [[Events]].
