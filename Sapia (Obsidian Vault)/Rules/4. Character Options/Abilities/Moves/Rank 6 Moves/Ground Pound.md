You slam into the ground, sending a shockwave around you. Creatures within a 20 ft radius must make a fortitude saving throw or suffer 6d10 force damage, be deafened until the start of your next turn, and fall prone. Creatures who succeed the saving throw suffer half damage.

*Upcast: You deal an additional 1d10 damage.*
