When you miss an attack roll or a target succeeds their saving throw against you, you can use your reaction to upcast the previous ability, retaining the previous d20 result. The GM must not tell you whether the counter will succeed until after it has resolved.

*Notes: In the case of an attack roll, you must use your previous dice result, now with an additional attack modifier. In the case of a saving throw, the target must use their previous result, now against a higher save DC.*
