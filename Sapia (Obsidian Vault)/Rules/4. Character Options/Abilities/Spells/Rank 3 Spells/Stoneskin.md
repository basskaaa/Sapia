The target's strength modifier and base defence increases by 5 for the duration, but they gain the [Slowed](https://www.notion.so/Slowed-a0c55d356fb1416eaa33b46155e757e5?pvs=21) condition and their weight is multiplied by 10.

Upcast: The targetâ€™s strength modifier and defence increase by an additional 1 per upcast.
