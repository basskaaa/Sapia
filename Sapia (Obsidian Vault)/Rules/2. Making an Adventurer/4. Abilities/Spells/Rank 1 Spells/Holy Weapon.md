You imbue one weapon that you are holding with divine power, adding your Wisdom modifier to attack rolls. The weapon also emits light in a 30-foot radius.

If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

*Upcast: Your attack roll modifier increases by 1.*
