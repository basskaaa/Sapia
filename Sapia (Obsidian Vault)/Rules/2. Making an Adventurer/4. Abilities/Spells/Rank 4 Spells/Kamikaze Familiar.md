You summon a flaming small size creature up to your level. The creature follows your commands, can make attacks, and has 1 hit point. When killed or at the start of your next turn, the familiar explodes, dealing 8d6 fire damage on a failed Fortitude save and half on a success.

Upcast: The familiar deals an additional 3d6 damage per upcast.
