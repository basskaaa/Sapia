### **Voice of Authority**

2nd level - During each long rest, you are given a task from your deity such as ‘Defeat the beast haunting the forest.’ The task is chosen by the GM, and must be relevant, challenging, but achievable.

If the task is successfully achieved before the start of the next long rest, you gain one use of ‘Portent’ which lasts until seven days have passed.

At any point in the next seven days, you can spend a use of ‘Portent’ to decide the outcome of any dice roll. This can occur before or after it has been rolled.

### **Aura of the Guardian**

5th level - You can shield others from harm at the cost of your own health. When a creature within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically take that damage, instead of the target. This feature doesn’t transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage cannot be reduced in any way.

### **Sentinel at Death’s Door**

8th level - As a reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are cancelled.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom Modifier per long rest.

### **Purity of Spirit**

14th level - You are always under the effects of an ‣ spell, and can cast the spell on others as though it were one rank lower.

### **Emissary of Redemption**

18th level - Whenever you suffer damage inflicted by a creature, it is reduced by an amount equal to your Wisdom score.

Additionally, whenever a creature hits you with an attack, it takes radiant damage equal to half the damage you take from the attack.

If you attack a creature, or deal damage to it by any means but this feature, neither benefit works against that creature until you finish a long rest.

Additionally, You gain Truesight with a range of 120 feet.
