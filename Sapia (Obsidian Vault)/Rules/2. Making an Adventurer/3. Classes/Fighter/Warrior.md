# Warrior

### **Fighting Spirit**

2nd level - Once per short rest, as a starter action on your turn, you can give yourself advantage on weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn. When you do so, you also gain a number of temporary [[hit points]] equivalent to your level.

Additionally, you become proficient in one weapon and one specialism.

### **War Machine**

5th level - when moving in the direction of an enemy you can sense, you gain a boost to your movement equal to 5 times your Dexterity modifier. This additional movement ignores difficult terrain.

### Execute

8th level - Once per short rest, you can turn one attack roll into a critical hit.

### **Inspiring Surge**

14th level - when you use Action Surge, choose one creature within 60 feet of you. That creature can use its reaction to take a main action on your turn.

Additionally, once per short rest, if you make an attack against a target at advantage, you can forgo the advantage for that roll to make an additional weapon attack against that target, as part of the same action.

### **Strength before Death**

18th level - When you fail a death saving throw, you can immediately take an additional main action.

Additionally, you can use Execute and Inspiring Surge twice per short rest.
