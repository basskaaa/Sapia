# School of Abjuration

### **Arcane Ward**

2nd level - You can cast the cantrip [Lesser Ward](https://www.notion.so/Lesser-Ward-44e3fd905dde4a8b8e215742a12c2713?pvs=21) as a starter action.

Additionally, once per long rest, when you cast an abjuration spell of rank 1 or higher, you can create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has a hit point maximum equal to your wizard level + your constitution modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 [[hit points]], you take any remaining damage.

While the ward has 0 [[hit points]], it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell, the ward regains a number of [[hit points]] equal to the mana cost of the spell.

### **Projected Ward**

5th level - When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 [[hit points]], the warded creature takes any remaining damage.

Additionally, when the ward is reduced to 0 [[hit points]], you choose a target within 30 ft takes damage equal to the ward’s hit point maximum.

### **Improved Abjuration**

8th level - when you cast an abjuration spell that requires you to make a skill check as a part of casting that spell, you add your proficiency bonus to that skill check.

Additionally, you can cast the spell [Greater Ward](https://www.notion.so/Greater-Ward-2ccaf4abae5d4f3592c0d153d62205d4?pvs=21) as a starter action.

### Counter Mage

14th level - You can cast the spell [Stoneskin](https://www.notion.so/Stoneskin-cd15f15a28c74e7f9b9466dad2ea936a?pvs=21) as though it was one rank lower.

Additionally, while you maintain concentration on a spell, you have a **+2** bonus to Defence and all saving throws.

### **Spell Resistance**

Furthermore, you have resistance against one magical or elemental damage type of your choosing.
