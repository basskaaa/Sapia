  - Overland Travel Pace
---
Often [[Adventurers]] are required to trek far and wide across the realms. Some are well-suited to this activity. Others are not. But when the fate of [[The Realms]] lies in your hands, you do what must be done.

To run travel encounters, you must carefully track time and distance. On foot and flat terrain, [[Adventurers]] move as a group at the pace of their slowest member. To calculate [[Overland Travel]] pace, divide your movement speed by 10. The resulting number is the amount of miles you can travel by foot in one hour.

[[Environments|Environmental Conditions]] also affect the [[Overland Travel|Overland Travel Pace]], such as terrain, weather, and [[Mounts]].
##### Difficult Overland Terrain
Unless the [[Overland Travel]] terrain is flat and navigable, [[Adventurers]] will be slowed down by it. Any difficult terrain such as mountains, swamps, or deserts, will reduce your [[Overland Travel|Overland Travel Pace]] by 1 mile per hour, unless your [[Mounts|Mount]] or [[Adventurers|Adventurer]] is specialised in these terrains.
##### Difficult Overland Weather
Unless the [[Overland Travel]] weather is clear, dry, and temperate, [[Adventurers]] will be slowed down by it. Any difficult weather such as extreme precipitation, wind, or temperatures, will reduce your [[Overland Travel|Overland Travel Pace]] by 1 mile per hour, unless your [[Mounts|Mount]] or [[Adventurers|Adventurer]] is specialised in these weathers.
##### Overland Mounts
Owning [[Mounts]] can be a great boon to an [[Adventurers|Adventuring Party]], as they can provide effective relief from difficult terrain and weather due to their unique specialisms. In some [[Adventurers|Adventuring Parties]], only one mount might be required, and in others a pack of beasts may be necessary. Keep in mind, [[Adventurers]] move as a group at the pace of their slowest member.

Some [[Mounts]] can give additional [[Overland Travel|Overland Travel Pace]] bonuses. When riding a [[Mounts|Mount]], [[Adventurers]] should be calculating their pace based on the [[Mounts|Mount]]'s movement speed, dividing it by 10 to find their travel pace per hour. If the [[Mounts|Mount]]'s movement speed exceeds your [[Adventurers|Adventurer]]'s, you might find yourself travelling much further and faster by [[Mounts|Mount]].
