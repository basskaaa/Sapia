For one minute, you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and fortitude saving throws.
- When you make a melee attack, your damage bonus increases by an amount equal to your strength modifier.
- You have resistance to physical damage.

You can cast and concentrate on spells while raging.

The rage ends early if you become [[Unconscious]] or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since the start of your last turn. You can also end your rage on your turn as a secondary action.

*Upcast: the duration increases by 1 minute*
