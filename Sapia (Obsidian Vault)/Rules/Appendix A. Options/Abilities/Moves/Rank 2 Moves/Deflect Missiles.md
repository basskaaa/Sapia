When you are hit by a ranged attack, the damage is reduced by an amount equal to **1d10** + your ability modifier.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile. If you catch a missile in this way, you can make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, with a range of 60 feet.

Upcast: You reduce the damage by an additional 1d10.
