# Idea
- Sapia: a narrative top down 3d role playing game emphasising player customisation, expression, strategy, and mastery.
- Deck building elements?
- Liner power curve, exponential power cost
- Set in frozen wasteland cut off from the world
- Emphasis on player action rather than dialogue - nonlinear
- Evolving world - waiting has consequences
- Inspirations:
	- Setting: Icewind Dale, Dwarf Fortress?
	- Art Style: A Short Hike, Skyrim (Winterhold)
	- Combat: Diablo, Xcom
	- Narrative: The Outer Wilds
	- Music: Dune, Halo
	- Inventory: Resident Evil 4, Terraria
- Core pillars: 
	- Nostalgia
	- Expression
	- Effect
	- Synergy
- *Tabletop design goals:*
	- *Rely less on DM interpretation and more on player creativity around official rulings*
