I'm planning to develop a fantasy RPG with the intention of publishing it for the 2025 Steam Next Fest.
#### The Team

The development team will consist of: 
- Andy Longhurst as lead programmer and systems engineer, whose focus will be on implementing rpg systems, combat systems, npc AI, and other such features.
- Luka Rollings as game designer, director, and supporting programmer, whose focus will be on designing compelling rpg gameplay systems, narrative arcs, visual aesthetic, level design, and other such features.
- Joe Noble as music composer.

This team has previously worked well together on the 2023 Summer Kenney Game Jam to create the short roguelike RPG ['Marco Yolo'](https://basska.itch.io/marco-yolo-lite), which was in the top 10/500 most popular games submitted to the jam during the voting period. 

Our strengths as a team are in creating compelling gameplay, rapid systems iteration, and delivering a cohesive and engaging game feel. Our weaknesses as a team are 3D and 2D art, which will be a big sticking point in developing the proposed game idea. To combat the weakness for 3D art, we will be using a pixel shader on all 3D assets to create visual cohesion between different 3D styles. 2D art will be necessary for many UI elements. If, later on in development, we feel that we are unable to source art assets from asset stores, we may consider art commissions or recruiting a game art student.

#### The Game

The game to be developed, currently going by the name 'Sapia', will be a top-down isometric RPG inspired by the likes of Diablo, Baldur's Gate, Torchlight, and others in the genre. The rules will be inspired from a prototype fantasy tabletop RPG I was working on a couple of years ago, with currently consist of roughly 25'000 words. The setting will be inspired by the fantasy world I created for my D&D campaign, which consists of 200'000 words of geopolitics and mythology.

To be able to produce and publish a game in a year, we will need to scope it carefully. The current plan is to aim for 12 hours of content, including combat systems, social systems, interaction and exploration systems, item upgrade systems, an outpost and small town, quests, npcs, etc. This will obviously be a lot for 2 developers to accomplish working part-time in a year so we will have to consider how we plan our development cycle carefully.
