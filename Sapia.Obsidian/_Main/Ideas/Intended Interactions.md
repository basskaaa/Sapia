# Exploration
- Free roam outside of initiative. Not grid based
- Can change camera from isometric 3rd person to perspective 1st person
# Travel
- Select destination on world map
- Calculate best route as spline
- For every hour of travel, roll d6 for weather and add result to random encounter clock
- When random encounter clock reaches 10, encounter occurs
- Travel visuals are generated by playing constant walking animation but shifting the player along the route spline in 5 second steps, changing the environment to simulate long distance travel

# Social
- Branching dialogue in fallout 2 style ui in bottom left screen corner
- Some options will have a hidden skill check (diplomacy, charm, knowledge) influenced by specialisms
- You can always open up right-side menu to see the hidden dice rolls. They won't be highlighted in gameplay so as to distance game feel from Baldur's Gate but can still be visible to show chance element of gameplay and effect of player choice on chance
- Saved only for important interactions
- While exploring, you can witness npcs having regular natural conversations. they will respond to your presence and tell you to go away or fetch them a drink if you want something
- Potential of this to affect faction response to you. factions being townsguard, townsfolk, town leaders
# Downtime
- In downtime you can use your skills to generate income based on dice rolls, or slowly learn new specialisms based on dice rolls, or rest to earn temp hit points, or improve your standing with factions
# Inventory
- Slot based. Opens up in top right corner not intruding gameplay (terraria style). Items have different weights accounting for different amount of slots taken. Total slots equal to strength score, though can get bags (with consequential debuffs) to increase this amount.
- Items can be used whenever outside combat or taking a starter/main action during combat
- Small items are stored in 'pockets' slot unless they reach a specified count
# Level Up
- Choose to put ability points into stamina or mana
- Get new features from class features list
- Select option choices
# Resting
- Full rest requires shelter, warmth, food
- Rough rest can be taken if one is missing, restoring half hit dice
- Short rest can be taken whenever
