The GM will often call for a d20 roll to determine the outcome of an action or event. For a favourable outcome, the result of the d20 must be higher than the DC (or Dice Challenge), which is determined by the outcome's likelihood or difficulty as follows:
- Easy difficulty - DC 10
- Moderate difficulty - DC 15
- Challenging difficulty - DC 20
- Extreme difficulty - DC 25
- Impossible difficulty - DC 35
