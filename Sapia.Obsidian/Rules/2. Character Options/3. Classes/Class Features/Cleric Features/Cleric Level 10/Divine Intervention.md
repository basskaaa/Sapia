10th level - you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf.

As a main action, describe the assistance you seek, and roll 1d100. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention.

If your deity intervenes, you canâ€™t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

Additionally, as a starter action, once per long rest, you can end the effect of a spell of a rank below your proficiency bonus on a target within 5 ft of you.
