On a long rest, roll 1d10. You gain a number of points of Divine Favour, that can be spent on any dice roll you make before your next long rest. Each point of divine favour you spend adds one to the dice roll.

If you followed your god’s alignment that day, you have advantage on your Divine Favour roll.

If you went against your god’s alignment that day, you have disadvantage on your Divine Favour roll.

Your Divine Favour die increases size to a d12 at level 7 and a d20 at level 14.
