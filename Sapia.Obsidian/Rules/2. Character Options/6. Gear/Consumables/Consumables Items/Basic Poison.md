Can be applied to a weapon on a short rest.

If a successful attack is made with a poisoned weapon, the target must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or suffer 1d6 damage per hour and not receive any benefits from a long rest.

The effects of the poison last for 24 hours or until cured, and can be remedied by sufficient medicine.
