The Elf-Kin are an ethereal species possessed by their collective dream state, in which they see glimpses of the fate of their people in past, present, and future. Their long lifespans offer them the potential to reach perfection in all that they do, though as a result they demand no less than it and despise those who seek to bring change to their long-practiced ways. Tall, light-footed, and of unmatched beauty, their communities rarely consider the plights of other folk, who are generally seen as tools or fodder for their grand purpose.

In the current age, elves are insular and few in number, remembering the time of their dominion before the Calamity. Their greatest numbers are found in the Southern High Elves, who obsess over recording the past-seeing dreams of their young and the prophesising dreams of their frail elders in hopes of preventing their total extinction. This does not stop the gods from interfering, however, and many elves seek their purpose far beyond the wilds of the south among the 'short-lived'.
