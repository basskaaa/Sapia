Halflings are a peaceable people, good-natured, and inclined to be friendly. They often find themselves as the middle-men between dwarves and humans, turning craft into coin with their innate charm. They also like to fill in the gaps in domestic work. Dwarves might not notice that their workshops fill up with old scraps, empty oil cans, and soot, but the halflings certainly do. They like things to be clean, put together, and respectable. Therefore, if something needs cleaning, fixing, mending, and put-right, halflings often do that job themselves. If they have any failings, itâ€™s their love of comforts and fear of the big world beyond.
