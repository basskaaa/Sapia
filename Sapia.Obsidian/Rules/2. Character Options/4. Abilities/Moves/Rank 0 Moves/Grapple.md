A target up to your size within range must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or be [[Pinned]] to you. The grappled target can attempt to escape by repeating the saving throw as a starter action on their turn.

As a main action on your turn, when a target is grappled, the target must succeed on an additional Fortitude saving throw or become [Restrained](https://www.notion.so/Restrained-eb69b455de7a4ea6a6138dd0d0ad51d7?pvs=21). The grappled target can attempt to escape by repeating the saving throw as a main action on their turn.
