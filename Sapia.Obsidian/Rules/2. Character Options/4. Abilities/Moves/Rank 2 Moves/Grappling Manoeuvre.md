On the next successful melee attack you make before the start of your next turn, the target must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or be [[Pinned]] to you. If the target is above your size category they automatically succeed on the saving throw. The grappled target can attempt to escape by repeating the saving throw as a main action on their turn.

As an attack on your turn, you can make the grappled target succeed on an additional Fortitude saving throw or become [[Restrained]]. The grappled target can attempt to escape by repeating the saving throw as a main action on their turn.
